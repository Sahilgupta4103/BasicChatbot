# BasicChatbot
Created a chatbot which knows what a chatbot is.

This chatbot is a very basic implementation of how to make a conversation Bot.

I took help from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_gXrw1RoKo&t=3487s

This chatBot can answer your questions about chatBot like (what is chatBot, What is the use of chatBot ect..)

To use this chatbot:
-> Click on ChatbotFile.ipynb
-> click on open in colab
-> upload the ChatBot.txt file on the drive which is available in the repository itsef
-> Run all the cells and you can have a conversation with the Bot in the last cell
